# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
Description:
This project involves predicting the cost of medical insurance based on various factors such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking habits, and region. The prediction model is built using a Linear Regression algorithm to provide accurate cost estimations.

# Installation:

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1-Clone the repository:

# Data Pre-Processing

The dataset is pre-processed by encoding catagorial variables.


insurance_dataset.replace({'sex':{'male':0, 'female':1}}, inplace=True)

insurance_dataset.replace({'smoker':{'yes':0,'no':1}}, inplace=True)

insurance_dataset.replace({'region':{'southeast':0, 'southwest':1, 'northeast':2, 'northwest': 3}}, inplace=True)

X = insurance_dataset.drop(columns='charges', axis=1)
Y = insurance_dataset['charges']
print(X)
print(Y)


# Model Training and Evaluation
A Linear Regression model is trained and evaluated on the dataset.

X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=2)
regressor = LinearRegression()
regressor.fit(X_train, Y_train)


training_data_prediction = regressor.predict(X_train)
r2_train = metrics.r2_score(Y_train, training_data_prediction)
print('R squared value (training data):', r2_train)


test_data_prediction = regressor.predict(X_test)
r2_test = metrics.r2_score(Y_test, test_data_prediction)
print('R squared value (test data):', r2_test)

# Results
The Linear Regression model provides the following R-squared values:

Training data: R squared value: 0.751
Test data: R squared value: 0.744

# Future Work
Streamlit App: A Streamlit app is currently under development to provide an interactive user interface for predicting medical insurance costs. The app will be dockerized and hosted on Heroku or AWS.
Deployment: Future updates will include detailed instructions for deploying the app.
